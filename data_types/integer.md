# Integer
Integers are, or can be, whole numbers. Can be positive or negative. Integers are not declared with a ` . ` decimal point and represented as a whole.
```py
sample : int = 123

>>> sample
123

>>> type(sample)
<class 'int'>
```

Unlike Javascript, or any other languages, Python can handle pretty large integers.
```py
sample : int = 7193209397147042915750149147

>>> sample
7193209397147042915750149147
```
